# Newspaper-Sentiment-Analysis

Welcome to the Newspaper Sentiment Analysis project! This project allows you to classify the sentiment of articles from a given newspaper based on their text.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
1.Python 3.x

2.Pip (Python package manager)

**Installation**

1.Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/newspaper-sentiment-analysis.git.

2.Navigate to the project directory using cd newspaper-sentiment-analysis.

3.Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.\

**Usage**

To classify the sentiment of articles from a newspaper, you will need to have access to the newspaper's API (Application Programming Interface) and be able to make API requests to retrieve the articles. You will also need to have a pre-trained sentiment analysis model that can take in the text of an article and output a label indicating the sentiment of the article (e.g. positive, negative, neutral).
To classify the topic of the articles, you will need to have a pre-trained topic classification model that can take in the text of an article and output a label indicating the topic of the article. Alternatively, you could use a keyword extraction tool to identify key terms in the article and use those to infer the topic.

To use the code in this project to classify the sentiment and topic of articles from a newspaper:

Replace your_api_key in api_key = "your_api_key" with your API key.
Replace https://api.newspaper.com/v1/articles in endpoint = "https://api.newspaper.com/v1/articles" with the API endpoint for the newspaper you want to analyze.
Modify the params dictionary to specify the date range for the articles you want to retrieve.
Run the script using python main.py.
The script will make an API request to retrieve the articles, pre-process the text, and pass it through the pre-trained sentiment analysis and topic classification models to classify the sentiment and topic of each article. The results will be printed to the console.
