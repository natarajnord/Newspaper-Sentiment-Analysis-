# Newspaper-Sentiment-Analysis

Welcome to the Newspaper Sentiment Analysis project! This project allows you to classify the sentiment of articles from a given newspaper based on their text.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

1.Python 3.x

2.Pip (Python package manager)

**Installation**

1.Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/newspaper-sentiment-analysis.git.

2.Navigate to the project directory using cd newspaper-sentiment-analysis.

3.Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

**Usage**

To classify the sentiment of articles from a newspaper, you will need to have access to the newspaper's API (Application Programming Interface) and be able to make API requests to retrieve the articles. You will also need to have a pre-trained sentiment analysis model that can take in the text of an article and output a label indicating the sentiment of the article (e.g. positive, negative, neutral).
To classify the topic of the articles, you will need to have a pre-trained topic classification model that can take in the text of an article and output a label indicating the topic of the article. Alternatively, you could use a keyword extraction tool to identify key terms in the article and use those to infer the topic.
